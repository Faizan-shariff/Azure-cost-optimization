-> Azure DevOps Pipeline Goals
We'll set up two-stage pipeline:

- Infrastructure Deployment – Uses Terraform to provision Azure resources.
- Function App Deployment – Deploys Azure Function to the provisioned app.

-> Please verify or adjust accordingly:

- You have a Service Connection named azure-service-connection with access to your Azure subscription.
- You’re using a Linux agent (Microsoft-hosted or self-hosted).

-> Required Terraform Environment Variables
Ensure you define these as pipeline variables or secrets (if not using federated workload identity):
- servicePrincipalId
- servicePrincipalKey
- subscriptionId
- tenantId

-> Optional: Add Pipeline Environment
- To make it even safer, consider using an Azure DevOps Environment for infra approval gates.

-> Deployment Flow Summary
Terraform Stage provisions:
- Resource Group
- Cosmos DB
- Storage Account
- Container

Function Stage packages and publishes the Azure Function
